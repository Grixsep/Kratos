## Poromechanics Application

The Poromechanics Application contains developments in flow in porous media problems within Kratos Multiphysics.

### Features:

- U_Pl small displacement element for single-phase flow in porous media (with
equal order interpolation, unstable under incompressible-undrained
conditions)

- Stable U_Pl small displacement element for saturated porous media
(with higher order interpolation for displacements)

- FIC-Stabilized U_Pl small displacement element for saturated porous media
(with equal order interpolation for displacements)

- U_Pl Quasi-zero-thickness interface elements for defining cracks and
joints

- U_Pl_Pg small displacement element for two-phase flow in porous media (diffusion of gas into liquid not included yet)

- Local and non-local isotropic damage constitutive laws for continuum

- Isotropic damage and plasticity constitutive laws for interface elements
