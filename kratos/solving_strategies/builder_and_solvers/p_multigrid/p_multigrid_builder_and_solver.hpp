/** @page P-Multigrid
 *
 *  P-Multigrid refers to a multigrid method whose coarsening strategy is based on shape functions of high order elements (quadratic elements already qualify in this case). This implementation also supports models with multifreedom constraints.
 *
 *  @section Overview
 *
 *  The system's entry point is the @ref PMultigridBuilderAndSolver, which is also the only exposed class to the rest of Kratos (other classes/functions/utilities should remain inside the P-Multigrid system and are not allowed to leak out). As the name suggests, the main responsibilities of this class are
 *  - allocating the left hand side matrix, as well as the right hand side vector and the solution vector
 *  - assembling the left hand side matrix, right hand side vector
 *  - solving the resulting linear system of equations.
 *
 *  Due to the current design of @ref Scheme and @ref BuilderAndSolver, there is a number of other tasks as well that either tie in the primary purpose or help in pre- and postprocessing:
 *  - allocation, assembly and imposiotion of @ref MasterSlaveConstraint "multifreedom constraints"
 *  - applying Dirichlet conditions
 *  - partial reassembly of the linear system
 *  - computing reactions.
 *
 *  Although the primary purpose of this system is to exploit the structure arising from a model using high order elements,
 *  the multigrid feature can be completely disabled to use it as a standard @ref BuilderAndSolver. One reason for
 *  doing this would be taking advantage of different constraint imposition methods, such as
 *  @ref AugmentedLagrangeConstraintAssembler "augmented Lagrange".
 *
 *  @section Coarse Hierarchy
 *
 *  @note The current implementation only supports a two-grid method, since the selection of high order elements
 *        in Kratos is limited, and does not yet justify an arbitrary depth. That said, adding support for it
 *        should be possible without major interface changes, but would involve minor changes in
 *        @ref PMultigridBuilderAndSolver and @ref PGrid, as well as major changes in @ref MakePRestrictionOperator.
 *
 *  The root grid (i.e.: the finest level) is stored in and represented by @ref PMultigridBuilderAndSolver, while
 *  coarse grids are represented by @ref PGrid in a linked list. The reason for this difference is the additional
 *  set of responsibilities of the root grid, namely the allocation and assembly of the finest level. Coarse grids
 *  do not perform assembly, but construct restriction operators that they then apply on the parent grid to compute
 *  their own system.
 *
 *  Another important distinction is that the coarse grids can have floating point types different than the root grid.
 *  This can be useful when the user has access to accelerator hardware (i.e.: GPUs). Coarse grids need not solve their
 *  own problems with high precision so they might as well use single precision floating point numbers to save VRAM,
 *  for example.
 *
 *  @section Constraints
 *
 *  Constraint assembly and imposition is extracted through @ref ConstraintAssembler "a dedicated interface" that
 *  currently supports @ref MasterSlaveConstraintAssembler "master-slave elimination",
 *  @ref AugmentedLagrangeConstraintAssembler "augmented Lagrange", and @ref NoOpConstraintAssembler "a dummy"
 *  for debugging.
 *
 *  @note If the multigrid feature is enabled, the current implementation only supports augmented Lagrange imposition.
 *
 *  @section Linear Solvers
 *
 *  Unlike other @ref BuilderAndSolver "BuilderAndSolvers", @ref PMultigridBuilderAndSolver does not use the linear
 *  solver provided to it from the python layer. The reason is that it must construct a solver for each grid level
 *  separately. These fall into two categories
 *  - smoothers for the finer grids (including the root grid)
 *  - linear solver for the coarsest grid (usually an AMG solver).
 *
 *  Instead of passing linear solver instances, the user must provide two sets of parameters for the two different
 *  solver categories, after which the grids take care of constructing their own instances.
